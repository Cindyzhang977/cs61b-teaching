# CS61B Guides
These guides are for _some_ of the most important concepts taught in CS61B. They are not meant to substitute lecture, but rather to supplement it. 
As a result, some familiarity with the material is assumed. For best results, read after watching lecture. 

Feel free to fill out [this](https://forms.gle/xJuSywsMHS6Lz1TT9) form to give me feedback/suggestions for these guides.
